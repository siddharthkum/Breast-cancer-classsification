# Breast Cancer Classification Project

Breast cancer is a prevalent form of cancer among women, characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in the breast tissue influenced by genetic and environmental factors. This abnormal cell proliferation results in the formation of tumors, categorized as either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Studies indicate that approximately 25% of breast cancer-related deaths occur in women aged 40 to 49. Although rare before the age of 25â€“30, cases have been diagnosed even in adolescents. According to the World Health Organization, one in 8 to 10 women faces the risk of developing breast cancer.

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify tumors as benign (1) or malignant (0) using a dataset obtained through fine needle aspiration. The dataset incorporates attributes such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, concavity, compactness, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimensions. When uncertainty arises in tumor diagnosis, data mining and machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression, become crucial.

## Logistic Regression Model

Logistic regression, a supervised learning technique, predicts categorical dependent variables using given independent variables. Our project designates 0 for malignant and 1 for benign tumors. The logistic regression model undergoes training and evaluation on respective datasets. Known for its simplicity and effectiveness in linearly separable datasets, logistic regression not only measures the relevance of independent variables but also indicates the direction of their relationship.

## Feature Selection

Feature selection using logistic regression aims to eliminate irrelevant features and enhance the model's accuracy.
